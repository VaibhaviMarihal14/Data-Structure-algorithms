A linked list :
is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. 
The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers 


In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

Linked lists are used because of their efficient insertion and deletion.

There are three common types of Linked List.
Singly Linked List.
Doubly Linked List.
Circular Linked List.



Advantages of LL :

they can grow or shrink during the execution of a program. 
Linked lists have efficient memory utilization. 
Memory is allocated whenever it is required and it is de-allocated (removed) when it is no longer needed. 
Insertion and Deletions are easier and efficient.




Disadvantages of LL :

In single link list every node contains a single pointer to represent next node So we can move only forwardly. 
Backward movement is not possible without recursion.
In single link list nodes are connected using a single pointer to point to the next node. 
If the link list is accidentally destroyed then the chances of data loss after the destruction point is maximum. Data recovery is not possible.
Extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list.









                                                Singly Linked List


Single linked list is a sequence of elements in which every element has link to its next element in the sequence. 
In any single linked list, the individual element is called as "Node". Every "Node" contains two fields, data field, and the next field.
