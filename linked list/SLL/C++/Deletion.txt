To delete a node from linked list, we need to do following steps.
1) Find previous node of the node to be deleted.
2) Change the next of previous node.
3) Free memory for the node to be deleted.


void single_llist::delete_pos()
{
    int pos, i, counter = 0;
    if (start == NULL)
    {
        cout<<"List is empty"<<endl;
        return;
    }
    cout<<"Enter the position of value to be deleted: ";
    cin>>pos;
    struct node *s, *ptr;
    s = start;
    if (pos == 1)
    {
        start = s->next;
    }
    else
    {
        while (s != NULL)
        {
            s = s->next;
            counter++;  
        }
        if (pos > 0 && pos <= counter)
        {
            s = start;
            for (i = 1;i < pos;i++)
            {
                ptr = s;
                s = s->next;
            }
            ptr->next = s->next;
        }
        else
        {
            cout<<"Position out of range"<<endl;
        }
        free(s);
        cout<<"Element Deleted"<<endl;
    }
}
