Bubble Sort:

The bubble sort gets its name because elements tend to move up into the correct order like bubbles rising to the surface.

Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, 
compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.





Worst and Average Case Time Complexity:- O(n*n). Worst case occurs when array is reverse sorted.

Best Case Time Complexity:- O(n). Best case occurs when array is already sorted.

Auxiliary Space:- O(1)





Program:

class BubbleSort 
{ 
	void bubbleSort(int arr[]) 
	{ 
		int n = arr.length; 
		for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) 
			for (int j = 0; j < n-i-1; j++) 
				if (arr[j] > arr[j+1]) 
				{ 
					int temp = arr[j]; 
					arr[j] = arr[j+1]; 
					arr[j+1] = temp; 
				} 
	} 

	void printArray(int arr[]) 
	{ 
		int n = arr.length; 
		for (int i=0; i<n; ++i) 
			System.out.print(arr[i] + " "); 
		System.out.println(); 
	} 

	public static void main(String args[]) 
	{ 
		BubbleSort ob = new BubbleSort(); 
		int arr[] = {64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90}; 
		ob.bubbleSort(arr); 
		System.out.println("Sorted array"); 
		ob.printArray(arr); 
	} 
} 

Output:
Sorted array:
11 12 22 25 34 64 90
