Sorting :

Sorting is a process of ordering or placing a list of elements from a collection in some kind of order.
Sorting can be done in ascending and descending order. It arranges the data in a sequence which makes searching easier.


Stable Sorting:

A sorting algorithm is said to be stable if two objects with equal keys appear in the 
same order in sorted output as they appear in the input array to be sorted.

Some sorting algorithms are stable by nature like Insertion sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, etc.
And 

Background: a "stable" sorting algorithm keeps the items with the same sorting key in order.



Unstable Sorting:

A sorting algorithm is said to be unstable if there are two or more objects with equal keys,
which don't appear in same order before and after sorting.

Some sorting algorithms are not, like Selection Sort, Quick Sort, etc.

Root cause of instability sorting is:
Swap of non adjacent elements.


EXAMPLE:

Suppose we have a list of 5-letter words:

peach
straw
apple
spork

If we sort the list by just the first letter of each word then a stable-sort would produce:

apple
peach
straw
spork

In an unstable sort algorithm, straw or spork may be interchanged,
but in a stable one, they stay in the same relative positions
(that is, since straw appears before spork in the input, it also appears before spork in the output).




NOTE:
you can make any sorting algorithm stable by adding an additional field for the original position, 
and using that when you have two elements whose primary key is equal.
